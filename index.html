                <p>“Avengers: Endgame” is the culmination of a decade of blockbuster filmmaking, the result of years of work from thousands of people. It is designed to be the most blockbuster of all the blockbusters, a movie with a dozen subplots colliding, and familiar faces from over 20 other movies. It’s really like nothing that Hollywood has produced before, existing not just to acknowledge or exploit the fans of this series, but to reward their love, patience, and undying adoration. The blunt thing you probably want to know most: It’s hard to see serious MCU fans walking away from this disappointed. It checks all the boxes, even ticking off a few ones that fans won’t expect to be on the list. It’s a satisfying end to a chapter of blockbuster history that will be hard to top for pure spectacle. In terms of sheer entertainment value, it’s on the higher end of the MCU, a film that elevates its most iconic heroes to the legendary status they deserve and provides a few legitimate thrills along the way.</p>

                <p>It may be a long time before viewers can appreciate the 2019 remake of "The Lion King" as a freestanding work, instead of judging it against the original. The 1994 version was "Hamlet" plus "Bambi" on the African veldt: a childhood-shaping, Oscar-winning blockbuster, the second-highest grossing feature film of its calendar year, one of the last great hand-drawn Disney animated features (Pixar's original "Toy Story" came out 18 months later), and a tear-producing machine. This remake was controversial long before it opened, mainly because it seemed to take the Walt Disney company's new branding strategy—remaking beloved animated films as CGI-dependent "live action" spectaculars—to its most drastic conclusion. It serves up the same story with different actors, different arrangements of beloved songs and soundtrack cues, a couple of original tunes, a few fresh scenes and sequences, and, of course, photorealistic animals. The latter are the movie's main selling point, so believable that one of my kids remarked afterward that sitting through the film was like watching a nature documentary on mute while the soundtrack to original "The Lion King" played in the background.</p>

                <p>When Steve Rogers’ Captain America passed the shield to Sam Wilson’s Falcon at the end of “Avengers: Endgame,” it marked the start of a new era for the star-spangled symbol.

                    “The Falcon and the Winter Soldier” follows Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie) struggling to take up the mantle of Captain America. Along for the ride is Bucky (Sebastian Stan), who is going through his own issues from his past life as the brainwashed assassin known as the Winter Soldier.

                    Together, the two battle a radicalized group of super soldiers known as the Flag Smashers, the new-faux Captain America John Walker (Wyatt Russell) and Zemo (Daniel Bruhl), the methodical villain who tore the Avengers apart in “Captain America: Civil War.” Sharon Carter (Emily VanCamp) returns as the former S.H.I.E.L.D. and CIA agent hiding in exile as the mysterious Power Broker. Oh, and Julia Louis-Dreyfuss makes an appearance here.

                    There is a lot happening in this show.

                    For the most part, the show works. Certain elements get more room to breathe here. That is the benefit of this being a six-episode series on Disney+ as opposed to a two-hour theatrical film.

                    The strongest element is something that the show could not afford to mess up: the story of Sam taking up the shield. He is constantly thrown into one situation after another that he has to navigate, and every time he proves why Steve chose him.

                    It goes back to what 2011’s “Captain America: The First Avenger” established: the idea of Captain America not just being the perfect soldier, but also a good man. Sam is a good man and it shows through his ability to handle situations humanely and fight against injustice. When he first flew into battle with the shield, I was cheering from my couch.</p>

                <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">Significant parts of the world's largest tropical forest have started to emit more CO2 than they absorb.

                    The south-east is worst-affected, say scientists, with higher rates of tree loss and an increasing number of fires.

                    Temperatures there have risen by three times the global average during the hottest months.Areas of our planet that absorb more carbon from the atmosphere - for example, in the form of the greenhouse gas CO2 - than they store are known as sinks.

                    The role played by the lands and forests of the Earth in soaking up carbon has been a critical factor in preventing faster rates of climate change.


                    Since the 1960s, these sinks have taken in around 25% of carbon emissions from the use of fossil fuels.

                    The Amazon, home to the world's largest tropical forest, has played a key role in absorbing and storing much of that carbon.

                    But the growing impacts of climate change and deforestation are taking their toll on this crucial CO2 sponge.</p>

                    According to UK business daily Financial Times, a presentation circulated among top executives in early 2021 said that only 37% of Nestle’s products, excluding pet food and specialised medical nutrition, achieved a rating of 3.5 or higher under Australia’s health star rating system. The company considered 3.5-star rating as the “recognised definition of health”. The system rates foods on a scale of 5 stars and is used by international groups as the benchmark.</p>
